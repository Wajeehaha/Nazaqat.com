# 🔧 Serverless Function Crash Fix Applied

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **Express Version Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Express v5.1.0 had compatibility issues with path-to-regexp in serverless environment
- **Solution**: Downgraded to Express v4.19.2 (stable and Vercel-tested)

### 2. **Route Handler Pattern**
- **Problem**: `app.all('*', ...)` pattern caused path-to-regexp parsing errors
- **Solution**: Changed to `app.use(...)` for catch-all routes

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **Automatic Deployment**
Your fixes have been pushed to GitHub, so Vercel will automatically redeploy your function within 1-2 minutes.

### **Manual Redeploy (if needed)**
If you want to force a redeploy:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

### **Test Your Fixed Deployment**
After deployment completes, test these URLs:

1. **Health Check**: `https://your-backend-url.vercel.app/api/health`
2. **Root Endpoint**: `https://your-backend-url.vercel.app/`
3. **API Endpoints**: `https://your-backend-url.vercel.app/api/nails`

## 🔍 **What Was the Problem?**

The error was caused by:
```
TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError
```

This happens when:
- Express v5+ has breaking changes with route patterns
- Certain route patterns (`*`, complex regex) don't parse correctly in serverless functions
- The path-to-regexp library (used internally by Express) couldn't handle the route pattern

## 📈 **Expected Results:**
- ✅ No more "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" errors
- ✅ All API endpoints working correctly
- ✅ Proper error handling for 404 routes
- ✅ Stable performance in serverless environment

## 🛠 **Technical Changes Made:**

### `package.json`:
```diff
- "express": "^5.1.0",
+ "express": "^4.19.2",
```

### `api/index.js`:
```diff
- app.all('*', (req, res) => {
+ app.use((req, res) => {
```

These changes ensure maximum compatibility with Vercel's serverless Node.js runtime.

## 🎉 **Your backend should now be working perfectly!**

Monitor the deployment in your Vercel dashboard and test the endpoints once the new version is live.
